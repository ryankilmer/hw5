My program, "Digital DJ", mimics the real DJ experience. There are two tracks to choose from, one on the left and one on the right. 
The play / pause buttons can be controlled by clicking them or by using the assigned key on the keyboard. 
The audio levels for each track are controllable using the keyboard. 
While a track is playing the size of the record will increase and will display the name of the song at the top.
